    <p title="Swapnil Thomare">Apple is a technology company that was founded on April 1, 1976 by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne. The company was started in Jobs' garage in Los Altos, California and initially sold personal computers. Apple's first computer, the Apple I, was designed and hand-built by Wozniak. It was sold as a motherboard (with CPU, RAM, and basic textual-video chips) for $666.66. The Apple I was sold as a motherboard (with CPU, RAM, and basic textual-video chips), which was less than what is offered on a current personal computer.<br>

        In 1977, Apple released the Apple II, which became one of the first successful personal computers on the market. It was the first computer to feature color graphics and was widely used in schools and businesses. In the 1980s, Apple released the Macintosh, which was the first personal computer to feature a graphical user interface and a mouse.<br>
        
        In the 1990s, Apple focused on personal digital assistants (PDAs) with the release of the Newton, and on portable music players with the iPod. In 2007, the iPhone was released, which revolutionized the smartphone market and helped establish Apple as a major player in the technology industry. In 2010, the iPad was released, which helped popularize tablet computing. Today, Apple continues to produce a range of products, including smartphones, tablets, laptops, and smartwatches.<br>
